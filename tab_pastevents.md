# Past Events

See all [recent events in MeetUp](https://www.meetup.com/owasp-slc/events/past/).

## February 22, 2022 - Mobile App Pen testing
* It's getting harder (to jailbreak and analyze)
* [Pentesting iOS without a jailbreak](https://medium.com/securing/pentesting-ios-apps-without-jailbreak-91809d23f64e)
* Many vulnerabilities are actually with the APIs mobile apps utilize
* [Proxyman.io](https://proxyman.io/)

## Thursday, January 12
* Developer Training
* Round Table Discussion

## November 22nd and talked about:
* OWASP's new [Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/) 2021
* OWASP Top 10 is almost entirely categories now with SSRF the last Top 10 that sounds like a single vulnerability; most are collections of dozens of CWEs
* XSS is now part of the broad injection category, but in some ways, a lot of these could be linked into even broader categories in the same way; there's a lot of overlap as illustrated by a [venn diagram](https://www.owasptopten.org/thedata) that was shared, but it was for the 2017 Top 10
* Lots of company's use OWASP Top 10 for training
* Top 10 can also be used for threat modeling/checklists or as a way to check tool/process coverage (e.g., does tool X find OWASP Top 10 A??)

## September 29, 2021
* Career progression in AppSec (from entry level up to technical tracks and management),
* How participating in conferences and events (e.g., CTF) can help entry level candidates,
* Impostor syndrom is common in this industry and we all often have to look things up or refresh our memory or learn something new,
* How technical leaders provide value by "scaling their services" (helping others be more effective).
