## September 29, 2021
* Career progression in AppSec (from entry level up to technical tracks and management),
* How participating in conferences and events (e.g., CTF) can help entry level candidates,
* Impostor syndrom is common in this industry and we all often have to look things up or refresh our memory or learn something new,
* How technical leaders provide value by "scaling their services" (helping others be more effective).
