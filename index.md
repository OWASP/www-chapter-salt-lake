We met virtually on Monday, November 22nd and talked about:
* OWASP's new [Top 10](https://owasp.org/Top10/) 2021
* OWASP Top 10 is almost entirely categories now with SSRF the last Top 10 that sounds like a single vulnerability; most are collections of dozens of CWEs
* XSS is now part of the broad injection category, but in some ways, a lot of these could be linked into even broader categories in the same way; there's a lot of overlap as illustrated by a [venn diagram](https://www.owasptopten.org/thedata) that was shared, but it was for the 2017 Top 10
* Lots of company's use OWASP Top 10 for training
* Top 10 can also be used for threat modeling/checklists or as a way to check tool/process coverage (e.g., does tool X find OWASP Top 10 A??)
