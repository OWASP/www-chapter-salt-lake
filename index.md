## Recent Events
### February 23rd, 2023 - virtual
* Talked mainly about metrics
  * How do you show value to your leadership (finding bugs earlier in SDLC and fixing them quicker; show value in $ of saved engineer time, customer happiness)
  * Mentioned Doug Hubbard's (the author) book on How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity
  * Success stories
### January 24th, 2023 - In person at HealthEquity
* HealthEquity hosted an onsite meet-up in Draper.
* We discussed third party scripts and how to secure them:
  * Discussed use of SRI for versioned scripts and how a CSP offers partial protection for dynamic scripts that can't be protected via SRI (primarily by preventing an attacker from including scripts from domains not allowed on the CSP).
  * Some script vendors are so big (e.g., Google) that if they were compromised, your company probably wouldn't be in the news even from the downstream impact, but if your script vendor is smaller and your data is sensitive, you could be the headline.
  * Limiting these types of risky scripts to less-used pages or only loading them when the user wants to use the functionality could help limit impact.
  * Other potential solutions include scanning the scripts (before as a preventive solution or even after as a detective solution [Seth had a solution along these lines]), using iframes, and/or using a tool like feroot.
